> Slip inside the eye of your mind  
> Don't you know you might find  
> A better place to play  
> You said that you'd never been  
> But all the things that you've seen  
> Will slowly fade away  
> So I start a revolution from my bed  
> Cus you said the brains I had went to my head  

> Step outside the summertime's in bloom  
> Stand up beside the fireplace  
> Take that look from off your face  
> You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
> And so Sally can wait,  
> she knows it's too late as we're walking on by  

> Her soul slides away,  
> but don't look back in anger  
> I heard you say  
> Take me to the place where you go  
> Where nobody knows if it's night or day  
> Please don't put your life in the hands  
> Of a Rock 'n Roll band  
> Who'll throw it all away  
> Gonna start the revolution from my bed  
> 'Cos you said the brains I had went to my head  

> Step outside cos summertime's in bloom  
> Stand up beside the fireplace  
> Take that look from off your face  
> Cos you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out  
> And So Sally can wait,  
> she knows it's too late as she's walking on by  

> My soul slides away,  
> but don't look back in anger  
> I heard you say  
> So Sally can wait,  
> she knows it's too late as we're walking on by  

> Her soul slides away,  
> but don't look back in anger  
> I heard you say  
> And So Sally can wait,  
> she knows it's too late and she's walking on by  

> My soul slides away,  
> but don't look back in anger,  
> don't look back in anger  
> I heard you say  
> At least not today
