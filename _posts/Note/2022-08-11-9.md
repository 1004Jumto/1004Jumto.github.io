## 🎶오늘의 노래

<strong>Sweet Dreams, My Dear</strong>  

> Can you hear the crystal melody  
> with a small hint of misery  
> Life sometimes promises warmth tomorrow  
> Just like a dusky sunset in splendor  
> I remember the humming sound is passing by  
> The tears we have held back  
> all the dreams that I have lost  
> in the Precious days  

> Just keep on dreaming and dreaming  
> alone in the faded paradise  
> your heart that is lighting up the world  
> Takes me to the beautiful dawn  
> Can you see the place I used to stay  
> waiting for you to call me  
> Life sometimes becomes a shining starlight  
> gazing at you make my heart more flutter  

> Just keep on dreaming and dreaming  
> don't you fold your wings in doubt  
> Each piece of precious memory  
> They will make you fly away  
> I will be there in your memory  
> sweet sweet dreams my dear
